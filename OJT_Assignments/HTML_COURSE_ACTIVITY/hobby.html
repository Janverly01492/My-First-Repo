        </a>

        <pre>

        <h2>Gaming</h2>

        <h3>Favorite Games</h3>
        <ul>
            <strong>Minecraft</strong>

            <pre>
Minecraft lets me slow down. I can build at my own pace,
explore freely, and create something from nothing.
It gives me a sense of control and progress.
            </pre>

            <strong>Call of Duty Mobile</strong>

            <pre>
Playing COD Mobile sharpens reflexes, improves strategic thinking,
and teaches teamwork through fast-paced matches.
It also provides excitement, stress relief, and a sense of accomplishment.
            </pre>

            <strong>Valorant</strong>
            <pre>
Valorant is a competitive tactical shooter that rewards strategy, skill, 
and teamwork. Every match is a mental and skill challenge that requires 
precision and communication.
            </pre>
