<!-- COMMENT/S
  
I remember when I was on my 2nd year (second sem), this is what our professor give to use to code in PAPER. 
I kind struggled a bit because there were no IDs nor class  on the elements. But I managed to finish it.
It took me around an hour or less to finish it. It was fun tho. I got the chance to expeeriment the past lessons and the current.
